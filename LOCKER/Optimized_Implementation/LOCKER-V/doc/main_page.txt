/*! \mainpage LOCKER - a LOw rank parity ChecK codes EncRyption scheme proposal based on Rank metric for the NIST call -
 *
 *  1. SUBMISSION OVERVIEW
 *  ----------------------
 *
 *  <b>LOCKER</b> is a post-quantum PKE based on rank metric codes. Both reference implementation and optimized implementation provided for this submission are the same. Nine parameters sets denoted respectively LOCKER-I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VII and IX are provided as explained in the supporting documentation. Each parameter set folder is organized as follows:
 * 
 *  - <b>bin/</b>: Files generated during compilation
 *  - <b>doc/</b>: Technical documentation of the scheme
 *  - <b>lib/</b>: Third party libraries used 
 *  - <b>src/</b>: Source code of the scheme  
 *  - <b>doxygen.conf</b>: Documentation configuration file
 *  - <b>configure</b>: Configuration file
 *  - <b>Makefile</b>: Makefile
 *  
 *  <br />
 *  
 *  2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 *  ----------------------------
 *  
 *  <h3>2.1 Requirements</h3>
 *
 *  The following softwares and librairies are required: <b>make</b>, <b>g++</b>, <b>openssl</b>, <b>ntl</b> and <b>gmp</b>.
 *
 *  <h3>2.2 Compilation Step</h3>
 *
 *  Let <b>X</b> denotes, for example, <b>I<b>, depending on the parameter set considered. LOCKER can be compiled in three differents ways:
 *  - Execute <b>make lockerX</b> to compile a working example of the scheme. Run <b>bin/lockerX</b> to execute the scheme and display its performances.
 *  - Execute <b>make lockerX-kat</b> to compile the NIST KAT generator. Run <b>bin/lockerX-kat</b> to generate KAT files.
 *  - Execute <b>make lockerX-verbose</b> to compile a working example of the scheme in verbose mode. Run <b>bin/lockerX-verbose</b> to generate intermediate values.
 *
 *  During compilation, the following files are created inside the <b>bin/build</b> folder:
 *  - <b>hash.o</b>: A wrapper around openssl SHA512 implementation
 *  - <b>rng.o</b>: NIST rng
 *  - <b>ffi_field.o</b>: Functions to manipulate finite fields.
 *  - <b>ffi_elt.o</b>: Functions to manipulate finite fields elements.
 *  - <b>ffi_vec.o</b>: Functions to manipulate vectors over finite fields.
 *  - <b>parsing.o</b>: Functions to parse public key, secret key and ciphertext of the scheme.
 *  - <b>decoder.o</b>: Functions to solve the cyclic-support error decoding problem (either in normal mode or verbose mode).
 *  - <b>kem.o</b>: The LOCKER scheme (either in normal mode or verbose mode).
 *
 * <br />

 *
 *  4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONS
 *  --------------------------
 *
 *  <h3>4.1 Implementation overview</h3>
 *
 *  The <b>LOCKER</b> scheme is defined in the api.h and parameters.h files and implemented in kem.cpp.
 *  During the decapsulation step, it uses a cyclic-support error decoder based on LRPC codes (see decoder.h and decoder.cpp). 
 *  The files ffi.h, ffi_field.h, ffi_elt.h, ffi_vec.h, ffi_field.cpp, ffi_elt.cpp and ffi_vec.cpp provide the functions performing the various operations over finite fields required by the scheme.
 *  As public key, secret key and ciphertext can manipulated either with theirs mathematical representations or as bit strings, the files parsing.h and parsing.cpp provide functions to switch between these two representations.
 *  Finally, the files hash.h, rng.h, <b>hash.c</b> and <b>rng.c</b> (inside the <b>lib/</b> folder) contain respectively a wrapper around OpenSSL SHA512 implementation and the NIST random functions.  
 *
 *  <h3>4.2 Finite field interface</h3>
 *
 *  LOCKER is a rank-based scheme and as such heavily relies on finite field arithmetic. 
 *  We have provided an interface for finite fields (through files ffi.h, ffi_field.h, ffi_elt.h and ffi_vec.h) describing the various operations required by the scheme. 
 *  In this submission, the <b>f</b>inite <b>f</b>ield <b>i</b>nterface (<b>ffi</b>) is implemented using the NTL library \cite shoup2001ntl but one should note that LOCKER can work with any implementation of our finite field interface as long as its API is respected. 
 *  
 *  In the context of our ffi interface, a finite field always describes an extension of a binary field namely a finite field of the form GF(2^m).
 *  The ffi interface works as follows:
 *  - <b>ffi.h</b>: Constants that defines the considered finite field ;
 *  - <b>ffi_field.h</b>: Functions to initialize finite fields ;
 *  - <b>ffi_elt.h</b>: Functions to manipulate elements of GF(2^m) ;
 *  - <b>ffi_vec.h</b>: Functions to manipulate either vectors over GF(2^m) or vector spaces spanned by a vector over GF(2^m).
 *  
 *  In addition, the <b>ffi_elt</b> and <b>ffi_vec</b> types are respectively implemented as NTL <b>GF2E</b> and <b>GF2EX</b> types.
 *
 *  <h3>4.3 Public key, secret key, ciphertext and shared secret</h3>
 *
 *  The representation we choose to store the vectors as bit strings may contain unecessary zeros that can be removed if necessary.
